Steps to manually generate basic-less-with-sourcemap-support.browserified.js
============================================================================

    # Clone GitHub repository of webextensions/less.js which is a fork of GitHub repository less/less.js
    #     Notes about the GitHub repository https://github.com/webextensions/less.js.git :
    #     * The repository https://github.com/webextensions/less.js.git is a fork of https://github.com/less/less.js (from the point https://github.com/less/less.js/tree/6986f3e0cb5e36a8656b050136ae226a070dc52b)
    #     * For the purpose of usage in Magic CSS extension, please use the branch "build-less-v4-for-magic-css" (https://github.com/webextensions/less.js/tree/build-less-v4-for-magic-css)
    #     * To create the above mentioned customized build, the commit added after forking can be found at https://github.com/webextensions/less.js/commit/1bf6a495a11dee77bb0f773149ff6261a4718c4d
    $ git clone https://github.com/webextensions/less.js.git

    # Change directory to the cloned repository
    $ cd less.js

    # Checkout the version from date 2017-07-16 (https://github.com/webextensions/less.js/tree/1bf6a495a11dee77bb0f773149ff6261a4718c4d)
    $ git checkout 1bf6a495a11dee77bb0f773149ff6261a4718c4d

    # Use Node 16.18.1
    $ nvm install 16.18.1

    # Install packages required by the project's package.json
    $ npm install

    $ cd packages/less/

    # You may wish to remove the pre-existing version of the file, under the "dist" directory
    $ rm dist/basic-less-with-sourcemap-support.browserified.js
    $ rm dist/basic-less-with-sourcemap-support.browserified.uglified.js

    # Generate basic-less-with-sourcemap-support.browserified.js inside "dist" directory using an npm script
    # This npm script would basically run two commands:
    #     > browserify -p esmify --entry src/less-node/index-basic-less-with-sourcemap-support.js --outfile dist/basic-less-with-sourcemap-support.browserified.js --standalone less
    #     > uglifyjs dist/basic-less-with-sourcemap-support.browserified.js --compress sequences=false --beautify beautify=false,semicolons=false,comments=some --output dist/basic-less-with-sourcemap-support.browserified.uglified.js
    $ npm run build:less-for-magic-css

    # Done! Now, the file is available at packages/less/dist/basic-less-with-sourcemap-support.browserified.js
