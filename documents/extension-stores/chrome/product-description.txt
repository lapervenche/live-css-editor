What some of our users say:

Justin Hale - ★★★★★
"This extension is great! It allows me to pinpoint specific css modifiers to overwrite them properly."

Johnny Petro - ★★★★★
"I would have never expected this: this extension has changed the way I write code. This basically turns Chrome into a live typesetting system. No more developing css in the chrome debugger. No more developing css in an IDE/editor. I feel like this turns Chrome into a word processor."

Tanner Legasse - ★★★★★
"I use this plugin on a daily basis. I don't mean just once or twice in a day, I mean it makes 5 hours of work take 2 for me, and I use it constantly."

Władzix - ★★★★★
"Incredible! Everything I was searching for, runs Live so you don't have to refresh every time you edit something, very nice suggestions while typing and other small features like colors are displayed in squares while typing names. One of the best features is auto enable on websites. I have made dark theme mode for some websites, thanks to this extension! Awesome!!!"
